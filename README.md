We have `2 players` and each of them has to roll the dice continously in hope to reach `25` points before the opponent.
Each time that they roll the dice the number is added to the current score, then you're introduce with two choices:
The first is to click the hold button to hold the score amount built, the second, you can keep building up your score, but whenever you roll a `1` your score will reset.
